ddl-auto=update ensures tables are created automatically based on your entities.

show-sql=true prints queries in console, useful for learning.

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
What it does:
Tells Hibernate to format the SQL statements it generates so they’re readable in your console.

Example:

Without formatting:

insert into students (first_name, last_name, email, enrolled_grade, id) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
With formatting:

insert into students
    (first_name, last_name, email, enrolled_grade, id)
values
    (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
Why it’s useful:
Makes long SQL statements easier to read during development, which is great for debugging and learning how JPA translates your entities to SQL.

2️⃣ spring.jpa.show-sql=true
What it does:
Tells Spring/Hibernate to print all SQL statements executed by JPA to the console.

Why it’s useful:
You can see exactly what SQL is being sent to MySQL whenever you call repository or service methods.

Note:
On its own, the output can be messy, so it’s often combined with format_sql=true for readability.

3️⃣ logging.level.org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql.BasicBinder=TRACE
What it does:
This controls the logging of the actual parameter values that Hibernate binds to your SQL statements.

Example:

For this entity insert:

Student student = new Student("Ali", "Khan", "ali@gmail.com", "G-09-A");
studentRepository.save(student);
With this logging:

binding parameter [1] as [VARCHAR] - [Ali]
binding parameter [2] as [VARCHAR] - [Khan]
binding parameter [3] as [VARCHAR] - [ali@gmail.com]
binding parameter [4] as [VARCHAR] - [G-09-A]
Why it’s useful:
Shows exactly what values Hibernate is sending to the database. Essential for debugging tricky problems like:

Wrong values being inserted

Nulls where you didn’t expect

Type mismatches
